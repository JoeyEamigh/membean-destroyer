# Chrome Extension to automatically "do" Membean work

pretty simple - i am not responsible for any trouble you get in for using this. This extension does in fact bypass the anti-cheat that Membean has built into their system, but should not be used for cheating. This is for educational purposes only.

This extension works as of 2/23/22. Membean could update their cryptography at any time and break the extension. I probably will not update it unless I am still in highschool when it breaks.

## Installation instructions

go to the releases tab and download the most recent one, then turn on developer mode on chrome://extensions and drop the .crx file into the window.

alternatively to build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JoeyEamigh/membean-destroyer.git
cd membean-destroyer
yarn
yarn build
```

once you have built the extension, go to the extension page in chrome, turn on developer mode, hit load unpacked, then select the build folder.

## Disclaimer again

this is for educational purposes only. dont sue me. not sure if I will open source it until I am done with this class.
